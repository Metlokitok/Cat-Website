Hello!

If you're reading this, thank you for checking out my first project!

This project serves as my test ground for learning html, css, and hopefully javascript.

This project will be constantly updated as I learn web development. This will include refactoring the entire code by using frameworks, adding backend stuff, database, etc.

If you'd like to help me, or have some suggestions,  let me know!

Thank you for your time!
